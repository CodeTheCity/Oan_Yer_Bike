## A cycling infrastructure map for Aberdeen City & Shire

[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IW99xQt3ZQ1PhpR2OaO9vPZ0IojuF8E-snjB-NPnN6g)

### Issues
- Open data on the subject is distinctly lacking in both City and Shire
- There is an exhastive map of cycling paths in Aberdeen, however this is in PDF format and the underlying data is not published to the public in any manchine-readable format
