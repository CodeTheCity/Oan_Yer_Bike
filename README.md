## A cycling infrastructure map for Aberdeen City & Shire

### Issues
- Open data on the subject is distinctly lacking in both City and Shire
- There is an exhastive map of cycling paths in Aberdeen, however this is in PDF format and the underlying data is not published to the public in any manchine-readable format
